### *Gala* by Bridget Riley, 1974; acrylic on canvas, 159.7 Ã— 159.7 cm {#gala-by-bridget-riley-1974-acrylic-on-canvas-1597--1597-cm}

Bridget Riley, a celebrated British artist, was a driving force behind
the Op Art movement of the 1960s. Her work features geometric patterns
that challenge the viewer's perceptions and evoke feelings of movement
or vibration. Her 1974 piece *Gala* showcases a series of curvilinear
forms that ripple across the canvas, evoking the natural rhythm of the
sine wave.
:::

In [Chapters 1](/vectors#section-vectors) and
[2](/forces#section-forces), I carefully worked out an object-oriented
structure to animate a shape in a p5.js canvas, using a vector to
represent position, velocity, and acceleration driven by forces in the
environment. I could move straight from here into topics such as
particle systems, steering forces, group behaviors, and more. However,
doing so would mean skipping a fundamental aspect of motion in the
natural world: **oscillation**, or the back-and-forth movement of an
object around a central point or position.

To model oscillation, you need to understand a little bit about
**trigonometry**, the mathematics of triangles. Learning some trig will
give you new tools to generate patterns and create new motion behaviors
in a p5.js sketch. You'll learn to harness angular velocity and
acceleration to spin objects as they move. You'll be able to use the
sine and cosine functions to model nice ease-in, ease-out wave patterns.
You'll also learn to calculate the more complex forces at play in
situations that involve angles, such as a pendulum swinging or a box
sliding down an incline.

I'll start with the basics of working with angles in p5.js, then cover
several aspects of trigonometry. In the end, I'll connect trigonometry
with what you learned about forces in [Chapter
2](/forces#section-forces). This chapter's content will pave the way for
more sophisticated examples that require trig later in this book.

## Angles

Before going any further, I need to make sure you understand how the
concept of an **angle** fits into creative coding in p5.js. If you have
experience with p5.js, you've undoubtedly encountered this issue while
using the `rotate()` function to rotate and spin objects. You're most
likely to be familiar with the concept of an angle as measured in
**degrees** (see Figure 3.1).

![Figure 3.1: Angles measured in
degrees](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_2.png)

::: half-width-right
![Figure 3.2: A square rotated by 45
degrees](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_3.png)
:::

A full rotation goes from 0 to 360 degrees, and 90 degrees (a right
angle) is one-fourth of 360, shown in Figure 3.1 as two perpendicular
lines.

Angles are commonly used in computer graphics to specify a rotation for
a shape. For example, the square in Figure 3.2 is rotated 45 degrees
around its center.

::: half-width-right
![Figure 3.3: The arc length for an angle of 1 radian is equal to the
radius.](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_4.png)
:::

The catch is that, by default, p5.js measures angles not in degrees but
in **radians**. This alternative unit of measurement is defined by the
ratio of the length of the arc of a circle (a segment of the circle's
circumference) to the radius of that circle. One radian is the angle at
which that ratio equals 1 (see Figure 3.3). A full circle (360 degrees)
is equivalent to [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"} radians, 180 degrees is
equivalent to [\\pi]{data-type="equation"} radians, and 90 degrees is
equivalent to [\\pi/2]{data-type="equation"} radians.

The formula to convert from degrees to radians is as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{radians} = {2\\pi \\times \\text{degrees} \\over 360}
:::

Thankfully, if you prefer to think of angles in degrees, you can call
`angleMode(DEGREES)`, or you can use the convenience function
`radians()` to convert values from degrees to radians. The constants
`PI`, `TWO_PI`, and `HALF_PI` are also available (equivalent to 180,
360, and 90 degrees, respectively). For example, here are two ways in
p5.js to rotate a shape by 60 degrees:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let angle = 60;
rotate(radians(angle));

angleMode(DEGREES);
rotate(angle);
```

::: {data-type="note"}
### What Is Pi?

The mathematical constant **pi** (or the Greek letter
[\\pi]{data-type="equation"}) is a real number defined as the ratio of a
circle's circumference (the distance around the outside of the circle)
to its diameter (a straight line that passes through the circle's
center). It's equal to approximately 3.14159 and can be accessed in
p5.js with the built-in `PI` variable.
:::

While degrees can be useful, for the purposes of this book, I'll be
working with radians because they're the standard unit of measurement
across many programming languages and graphics environments. If they're
new to you, this is a good opportunity to practice! Additionally, if you
aren't familiar with the way rotation is implemented in p5.js, I
recommend watching [my Coding Train video series on transformations in
p5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/transformations).

## Angular Motion

Another term for rotation is **angular motion**---that is, motion about
an angle. Just as linear motion can be described in terms of
velocity---the rate at which an object's position changes over
time---angular motion can be described in terms of **angular
velocity**---the rate at which an object's angle changes over time. By
extension, **angular acceleration** describes changes in an object's
angular velocity.

Luckily, you already have all the math you need to understand angular
motion. Remember the stuff I dedicated almost all of [Chapters
1](/vectors#section-vectors) and [2](/forces#section-forces) to
explaining?

::::: avoid-break
::: {data-type="equation"}
\\overrightarrow{\\text{velocity}} =
\\overrightarrow{\\text{velocity}} +
\\overrightarrow{\\text{acceleration}}
:::

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\overrightarrow{\\text{position}} =
\\overrightarrow{\\text{position}} + \\overrightarrow{\\text{velocity}}
:::
:::::

You can apply exactly the same logic to a rotating object:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{angular velocity} = \\text{angular velocity} +
\\text{angular\~acceleration}
:::

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{angle} = \\text{angle} + \\text{angular velocity}
:::

In fact, these angular motion formulas are simpler than their linear
motion equivalents since the angle here is a *scalar* quantity (a single
number), not a vector! This is because in 2D space, there's one axis of
rotation; in 3D space, the angle would become a vector. (Note that in
most contexts, these formulas would include a multiplication by the
change in time, referred to as *delta time*. I'm assuming a delta time
of 1 that corresponds to one frame of animation in p5.js.)

Using the answer from Exercise 3.1, let's say you wanted to rotate a
baton in p5.js by a certain angle. Originally, the code might have read
as follows:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
translate(width / 2, height / 2);
rotate(angle);
line(-60, 0, 60, 0);
circle(60, 0, 16);
circle(-60, 0, 16, 16);

angle = angle + 0.1;
```

Adding in the principles of angular motion, I can instead write the
following example (the solution to Exercise 3.1).

::: {data-type="example"}
### Example 3.1: Angular Motion Using rotate() {#example-31-angular-motion-using-rotate}

</div>
</figure>
:::

::: avoid-break
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// Position
let angle = 0;
// Velocity
let angleVelocity = 0;
// Acceleration
let angleAcceleration = 0.0001;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 240);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  //{!1} Rotate according to that angle.
  rotate(angle);
  stroke(0);
  fill(127);
  line(-60, 0, 60, 0);
  circle(60, 0, 16);
  circle(-60, 0, 16);
  // Angular equivalent of velocity.add(acceleration)
  angleVelocity += angleAcceleration;
  // Angular equivalent of position.add(velocity)
  angle += angleVelocity;
}
```
:::

Instead of incrementing `angle` by a fixed amount to steadily rotate the
baton, for every frame I add `angleAcceleration` to `angleVelocity`,
then add `angleVelocity` to `angle`. As a result, the baton starts with
no rotation and then spins faster and faster as the angular velocity
accelerates.

::: {data-type="exercise"}
### Exercise 3.2 {#exercise-32}

Add an interaction to the spinning baton. How can you control the
acceleration with the mouse? Can you introduce the idea of drag,
decreasing the angular velocity over time so the baton eventually comes
to rest?
:::

The logical next step is to incorporate this idea of angular motion into
the `Mover` class. First, I need to add some variables to the class's
constructor:

::: snip-below
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
class Mover {
  constructor() {
    this.position = createVector();
    this.velocity = createVector();
    this.acceleration = createVector();
    this.mass = 1.0;
    // Variables for angular motion
    this.angle = 0;
    this.angleVelocity = 0;
    this.angleAcceleration = 0;
  }
```
:::

Then, in `update()`, the mover's position and angle are updated
according to the algorithm I just demonstrated:

::: {.snip-below .snip-above}
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  update() {
    // Regular old-fashioned motion
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
    //{!2} Newfangled angular motion
    this.angleVelocity += this.angleAcceleration;
    this.angle += this.angleVelocity;
    this.acceleration.mult(0);
  }
```
:::

Of course, for any of this to matter, I also need to rotate the object
when drawing it in the `show()` method. (I'll add a line from the center
to the edge of the circle so that rotation is visible. You could also
draw the object as a shape other than a circle.)

::: {.snip-below .snip-above}
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  show() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(175, 200);
    // Use push() to save the current state so the rotation of this shape doesnâ€™t affect the rest of the world.
    push();
    // Set the origin at the shapeâ€™s position.
    translate(this.position.x, this.position.y);
    //{!1} Rotate by the angle.
    rotate(this.angle);
    circle(0, 0, this.radius * 2);
    line(0, 0, this.radius, 0);
    // Use pop() to restore the previous state after rotation is complete.
    pop();
  }
```
:::

At this point, if you were to actually go ahead and create a `Mover`
object, you wouldn't see it\
behave any differently. This is because the angular acceleration is
initialized to zero (`this.angleAcceleration = 0;`). For the object to
rotate, it needs a nonzero acceleration! Certainly, one option is to
hardcode a number in the constructor:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
    this.angleAcceleration = 0.01;
```

You can produce a more interesting result, however, by dynamically
assigning an angular acceleration in the `update()` method according to
forces in the environment. This could be my cue to start researching the
physics of angular acceleration based on the concepts of
[torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque) and [moment of
inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia), but at this
stage, that level of simulation would be a bit of a rabbit hole. (I'll
cover modeling angular acceleration with a pendulum in more detail in
["The Pendulum"](#the-pendulum){.page-reference}, as well as look at how
third-party physics libraries realistically model rotational motion in
[Chapter 6](/physics-libraries#section-physics-libraries).)

Instead, a quick-and-dirty solution that yields creative results will
suffice. A reasonable approach is to calculate angular acceleration as a
function of the object's linear acceleration, its rate of change of
velocity along a path vector, as opposed to its rotation. Here's an
example:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
    // Use the x-component of the objectâ€™s linear acceleration to calculate angular acceleration.
    this.angleAcceleration = this.acceleration.x;
```

Yes, this is arbitrary, but it does do *something*. If the object is
accelerating to the right, its angular rotation accelerates in a
clockwise direction; acceleration to the left results in a
counterclockwise rotation. Of course, it's important to think about
scale in this case. The value of the acceleration vector's `x` component
might be too large, causing the object to spin in a way that looks
ridiculous or unrealistic. You might even notice a visual illusion
called the *wagon wheel effect*: an object appears to be rotating more
slowly or even in the opposite direction because of the large changes
between each frame of animation.

Dividing the `x` component by a value, or perhaps constraining the
angular velocity to a reasonable range, could really help. Here's the
entire `update()` function with these tweaks added.

  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
    //{!1} Calculate angular acceleration according to accelerationâ€™s x-component.
    this.angleAcceleration = this.acceleration.x / 10.0;
    this.angleVelocity += this.angleAcceleration;
    //{!1} Use constrain() to ensure that angular velocity doesnâ€™t spin out of control.
    this.angleVelocity = constrain(this.angleVelocity, -0.1, 0.1);
    this.angle += this.angleVelocity;
    this.acceleration.mult(0);
  }
```

Notice that I've used multiple strategies to keep the object from
spinning out of control. First, I divide `acceleration.x` by `10` before
assigning it to `angleAcceleration`. Then, for good measure, I also use
`constrain()` to confine `angleVelocity` to the range `(â€“0.1, 0.1)`.

### Exercise 3.3 {#exercise-33}

Step 1: Create a simulation of objects being shot out of a cannon. Each
object should experience a sudden force when shot (just once) as well as
gravity (always present).

Step 2: Add rotation to the object to model its spin as it's shot from
the cannon. How realistic can you make it look?

## Trigonometry Functions

I think I'm ready to reveal the secret of trigonometry. I've discussed
angles, I've spun a baton. Now it's time for . . . wait for it . . .
*sohcahtoa*. Yes, *sohcahtoa*! This seemingly nonsensical word is
actually the foundation for much of computer graphics work. A basic
understanding of trigonometry is essential if you want to calculate
angles, figure out distances between points, and work with circles,
arcs, or lines. And *sohcahtoa* is a mnemonic device (albeit a somewhat
absurd one) for remembering the meanings of the trigonometric functions
sine, cosine, and tangent. It references the sides of a right triangle,
as shown in Figure 3.4.

![Figure 3.4: A right triangle showing the sides as adjacent, opposite,
and hypotenuse](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_5.png)

Take one of the non-right angles in the triangle. The *adjacent* side is
the one touching that angle, the *opposite* side is the one not touching
that angle, and the *hypotenuse* is the side opposite the right angle.
*Sohcahtoa* tells you how to calculate the angle's trigonometric
functions in terms of the lengths of these sides:

-   **soh:** [\\text{\\textbf{s}ine(angle)} =
    \\text{\\textbf{o}pposite}/\\text{\\textbf{h}ypotenuse}]{data-type="equation"}
-   **cah:** [\\text{\\textbf{c}osine(angle)} =
    \\text{\\textbf{a}djacent} /
    \\text{\\textbf{h}ypotenuse}]{data-type="equation"}
-   **toa:** [\\text{\\textbf{t}angent(angle)} =
    \\text{\\textbf{o}pposite} /
    \\text{\\textbf{a}djacent}]{data-type="equation"}

Take a look at Figure 3.4 again. You don't need to memorize it, but see
if you feel comfortable with it. Try redrawing it yourself. Next, let's
look at it in a slightly different way (see Figure 3.5).

::: half-width-right

alt="Figure 3.5: A vector \vec{v} with components x, y, and angle" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.5: A vector <span
data-type="equation">\vec{v}</span> with components <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, and <em>angle</em></figcaption>
</figure>
:::

See how a right triangle is created from the vector
[\\vec{v}]{data-type="equation"}? The vector arrow is the hypotenuse,
and the components of the vector (*x* and *y*) are the sides of the
triangle. The angle is an additional means for specifying the vector's
direction (or *heading*). Viewed in this way, the trigonometric
functions establish a relationship between the components of a vector
and its direction + magnitude. As such, trigonometry will prove very
useful throughout this book. To illustrate this, let's look at an
example that requires the tangent function.

## Pointing in the Direction of Movement

Think all the way back to Example 1.10, which featured a `Mover` object
accelerating toward the mouse (Figure 3.6).

<figure>
<div data-type="embed"

</div>
<figcaption>Figure 3.6: A mover accelerating toward the mouse (from
Example 1.10)</figcaption>
</figure>

You might notice that almost all the shapes I've been drawing so far
have been circles. This is convenient for several reasons, one of which
is that using circles allows me to avoid the question of rotation.
Rotate a circle and, well, it looks exactly the same. Nevertheless,
there comes a time in all motion programmers' lives when they want to
move something around onscreen that isn't shaped like a circle. Perhaps
it's an ant, or a car, or a spaceship. To look realistic, that object
should point in its direction of movement.

When I say "point in its direction of movement," what I really mean is
"rotate according to its velocity vector." Velocity is a vector, with an
x- and y-component, but to rotate in p5.js, you need one number, an
angle. Let's look at the trigonometry diagram once more, this time
focused on an object's velocity vector (Figure 3.7).

<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_7.png"
alt="Figure 3.7: The tangent of a velocity vectorâ€™s angle is y divided by x." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.7: The tangent of a velocity
vectorâ€™s angle is <em>y</em> divided by <em>x</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>

The vector's x- and y-components are related to its angle through the
tangent function. Using the *toa* in *sohcahtoa*, I can write the
relationship as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{tangent(angle)} =
\\frac{\\text{velocity}\_y}{\\text{velocity}\_x}
:::

The problem here is that while I know the x- and y-components of the
velocity vector, I don't know the angle of its direction. I have to
solve for that angle. This is where another function known as the
*inverse tangent*, or *arctangent* (*arctan* or *atan*, for short),
comes in. (There are also *inverse sine* and *inverse cosine* functions,
called *arcsine* and *arccosine*, respectively.)

If the tangent of value *a* equals value *b*, then the inverse tangent
of *b* equals *a*. For example:

  ------ -----------------------------------------
  If     [\\tan(a) = b]{data-type="equation"}
  then   [a = \\arctan(b)]{data-type="equation"}
  ------ -----------------------------------------

See how one is the inverse of the other? This allows me to solve for the
vector's angle:

  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If     [\\tan(\\text{angle}) = \\frac{\\text{velocity}\_y}{\\text{velocity}\_x}]{data-type="equation"}
  then   [\\text{angle} = \\arctan(\\frac{\\text{velocity}\_y}{\\text{velocity}\_x})]{data-type="equation"}
  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that I have the formula, let's see where it should go in the `Mover`
class's `show()` method to make the mover (now drawn as a rectangle)
point in its direction of motion. Note that in p5.js, the function for
inverse tangent is `atan()`:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  show() {
    //{!1} Solve for the angle by using atan().
    let angle = atan(this.velocity.y / this.velocity.x);
    stroke(0);
    fill(175);
    push();
    rectMode(CENTER);
    translate(this.position.x, this.position.y);
    //{!1} Rotate according to that angle.
    rotate(angle);
    rect(0, 0, 30, 10);
    pop();
  }
```

::: half-width-right
<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_8.png"
alt="Figure 3.8: The vectors \vec{v}_1 and \vec{v}_2 with components (4, â€“3) and (â€“4, 3) point in opposite directions." />

</figure>
:::

This code is pretty darn close and almost works. There's a big problem,
though. Consider the two velocity vectors depicted in Figure 3.8.

Though superficially similar, the two vectors point in quite different
directions---opposite directions, in fact! In spite of this, look at
what happens if I apply the inverse tangent formula to solve for the
angle of each vector:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\vec{v}\_1 â‡’ \\text{angle} = \\arctan(3/{-4}) = \\arctan(-0.75) =
-0.643501 \\text{ radians} = -37 \\text{ degrees}
:::

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\vec{v}\_2 â‡’ \\text{angle} = \\arctan(-3/4) = \\arctan(-0.75) =
-0.643501 \\text{ radians} = -37 \\text{ degrees}
:::

I get the same angle! That can't be right, though, since the vectors are
pointing in opposite directions. It turns out this is a pretty common
problem in computer graphics. I could use `atan()` along with
conditional statements to account for positive/negative scenarios, but
p5.js (along with most programming environments) has a helpful function
called `atan2()` that resolves the issue for me.

    //{!1} Rotate according to that angle.
    rotate(angle);
    rect(0, 0, 30, 10);
    pop();
  }
```
:::

To simplify this even further, the `p5.Vector` class provides a method
called `heading()`, which takes care of calling `atan2()` and returns
the 2D direction angle, in radians, for any `p5.Vector`:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
    // The easiest way to do this!
    let angle = this.velocity.heading();
```

With `heading()`, it turns out you don't actually need to implement the
trigonometry functions in your code, but understanding how they're all
working is still helpful.

## Polar vs. Cartesian Coordinates {#polar-vs-cartesian-coordinates}

Anytime you draw a shape in p5.js, you have to specify a pixel position,
a set of x- and y-coordinates. These are known as **Cartesian
coordinates**, named for RenÃ© Descartes, the French mathematician who
developed the ideas behind Cartesian space.

Another useful coordinate system, known as **polar coordinates**,
describes a point in space as a distance from the origin (like the
radius of a circle) and an angle of rotation around the origin (usually
called [\\theta]{data-type="equation"}, the Greek letter theta).
Thinking in terms of vectors, a Cartesian coordinate describes a
vector's x- and y-components, whereas a polar coordinate describes a
vector's magnitude (length) and direction (angle).

When working in p5.js, you may find it more convenient to think in polar
coordinates, especially when creating sketches that involve rotational
or circular movements. However, p5.js's drawing functions understand
only (*x*, *y*) Cartesian coordinates. Happily for you, trigonometry
holds the key to converting back and forth between polar and Cartesian
(see Figure 3.9). This allows you to design with whatever coordinate
system you have in mind, while always drawing using Cartesian
coordinates.

angle. Since a polar coordinate is conventionally referred to as <span
data-type="equation">(r, \theta)</span>, Iâ€™ll use <code>theta</code> as
a variable name when referring to an angle in p5.js.</figcaption>
</figure>

For example, given a polar coordinate with a radius of 75 pixels and an
angle ([\\theta]{data-type="equation"}) of 45 degrees (or
[\\pi/4]{data-type="equation"} radians), the Cartesian *x* and *y* can
be computed as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\cos(\\theta) = x/r \\Rightarrow x = r \\times \\cos(\\theta)
:::

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\sin(\\theta) = y / r \\Rightarrow y = r \\times \\sin(\\theta)
:::

The functions for sine and cosine in p5.js are `sin()` and `cos()`,
respectively. Each takes one argument, a number representing an angle in
radians. These formulas can thus be coded as follows:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let r = 75;
let theta = PI / 4;
// Convert from polar (r, theta) to Cartesian (x, y).
let x = r * cos(theta);
let y = r * sin(theta);
```

This type of conversion can be useful in certain applications. For
instance, moving a shape along a circular path using Cartesian
coordinates isn't so easy. However, with polar coordinates, it's simple:
just increment the angle! Here's how it's done with global `r` and
`theta` variables.

::: avoid-break
Polar-to-Cartesian conversion is common enough that p5.js includes a
handy function to take care of it for you. It's included as a static
method of the `p5.Vector` class called `fromAngle()`. It takes an angle
in radians and creates a unit vector in Cartesian space that points in
the direction specified by the angle. Here's how that would look in
Example 3.4:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  // Create a unit vector pointing in the direction of an angle.
  let position = p5.Vector.fromAngle(theta);
  // To complete polar-to-Cartesian conversion, scale position by r.
  position.mult(r);
  // Draw the circle by using the x- and y-components of the vector.
  circle(position.x, position.y, 48);
```

Are you amazed yet? I've demonstrated some pretty great uses of tangent
(for finding the angle of a vector) and sine and cosine (for converting
from polar to Cartesian coordinates). I could stop right here and be
satisfied. But I'm not going to. This is only the beginning. As I'll
show you next, what sine and cosine can do for you goes beyond
mathematical formulas and right triangles.

## Properties of Oscillation

Take a look at the graph of the sine function in Figure 3.10, where *y*
= sin(*x*).

<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_10.png"
alt="Figure 3.10: A graph of y = sin(x)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.10: A graph of <em>y</em> =
sin(<em>x</em>)</figcaption>
</figure>

The output of the sine function is a smooth curve alternating between
--1 and 1, also known as a **sine wave**. This behavior, a periodic
movement between two points, is the **oscillation** I mentioned at the
start of the chapter. Plucking a guitar string, swinging a pendulum,
bouncing on a pogo stick---all are examples of oscillating motion that
can be modeled using the sine function.

In a p5.js sketch, you can simulate oscillation by assigning the output
of the sine function to an object's position. I'll begin with a basic
scenario: I want a circle to oscillate between the left side and the
right side of a canvas (Figure 3.11).

<figure>
<div data-type="embed"

<img

</div>
<figcaption>Figure 3.11: An oscillating circle</figcaption>
</figure>

This pattern of oscillating back and forth around a central point is
known as **simple harmonic motion** (or, to be fancier, the periodic
sinusoidal oscillation of an object). The code to achieve it is
remarkably simple, but before I get into it, I'd like to introduce some
of the key terminology related to oscillation (and waves).

When a moving object exhibits simple harmonic motion, its position (in
this case, the x-position) can be expressed as a function of time, with
the following two elements:

-   **Amplitude:** The distance from the center of motion to either
    extreme
-   **Period:** The duration (time) for one complete cycle of motion

To understand these terms, look again at the graph of the sine function
in Figure 3.10. The curve never rises above 1 or below --1 along the
y-axis, so the sine function has an amplitude of 1. Meanwhile, the wave
pattern of the curve repeats every [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"} units
along the x-axis, so the sine function's period is
[2\\pi]{data-type="equation"}. (By convention, the units here are
radians, since the input value to the sine function is customarily an
angle measured in radians.)

So much for the amplitude and period of an abstract sine function, but
what are amplitude and period in the p5.js world of an oscillating
circle? Well, amplitude can be measured rather easily in pixels. For
example, if the canvas is 200 pixels wide, I might choose to oscillate
around the center of the canvas, going between 100 pixels right of
center and 100 pixels left of center. In other words, the amplitude is
100 pixels.

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// The amplitude is measured in pixels.
let amplitude = 100;
```

The period is the amount of time for one complete cycle of an
oscillation. However, in a p5.js sketch, what does *time* really mean?
In theory, I could say I want the circle to oscillate every three
seconds, then come up with an elaborate algorithm for moving the object
according to real-world time, using `millis()` to track the passage of
milliseconds. For what I'm trying to accomplish here, however,
real-world time isn't necessary. The more useful measure of time in
p5.js is the number of **frames** that have elapsed, available through
the built-in `frameCount` variable. Do I want the oscillating motion to
repeat every 30 frames? Every 50 frames? For now, how about a period of
120 frames:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// The period is measured in frames (the unit of time for animation).
let period = 120;
```

Once I have the amplitude and period, it's time to write a formula to
calculate the circle's x-position as a function of time (the current
frame count):

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// amplitude and period are my own variables; frameCount is built into p5.js.
let x = amplitude * sin(TWO_PI * frameCount / period);
```

Think about what's going here. First, whatever value the `sin()`
function returns is multiplied by `amplitude`. As you saw in Figure
3.10, the output of the sine function oscillates between --1 and 1.
Multiplying that value by my chosen amplitude---call it *a*---gives me
the desired result: a value that oscillates between --*a* and *a*. (This
is also a place where you could use p5.js's `map()` function to map the
output of `sin()` to a custom range.)

Now, think about what's inside the `sin()` function:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
TWO_PI * frameCount / period
```

What's going on here? Start with what you know. I've explained that sine
has a period of [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"}, meaning it will start at
0 and repeat at [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"},
[4\\pi]{data-type="equation"}, [6\\pi]{data-type="equation"}, and so on.
If my desired period of oscillation is 120 frames, I want the circle to
be in the same position when `frameCount` is at 120 frames, 240 frames,
360 frames, and so on. Here, `frameCount` is the only value changing
over time; it starts at 0 and counts upward. Let's take a look at what
the formula yields as `frameCount` increases.

  `frameCount`   `frameCount / period`   `TWO_PI * frameCount / period`
  -------------- ----------------------- --------------------------------
  0              0                       0
  60             0.5                     [\\pi]{data-type="equation"}
  120            1                       [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"}
  240            2                       [4\\pi]{data-type="equation"}
  . . .          . . .                   . . .

Dividing `frameCount` by `period` tells me the number of cycles that
have been completed. (Is the wave halfway through the first cycle? Have
two cycles completed?) Multiplying that number by `TWO_PI`, I get the
desired result, an appropriate input to the `sin()` function, since
`TWO_PI` is the value required for sine (or cosine) to complete one full
cycle.

Putting it together, here's an example that oscillates the `x` position
of a circle with an amplitude of 100 pixels and a period of 120 frames.

Before moving on, I would be remiss not to mention **frequency**, the
number of cycles of an oscillation per time unit. Frequency is the
inverse of the period---that is, 1 divided by the period. For example,
if the period is 120 frames, only 1/120th of a cycle is completed in 1
frame, and so the frequency is 1/120. In Example 3.5, I chose to define
the rate of oscillation in terms of the period, and therefore I didn't
need a variable for frequency. Sometimes, however, thinking in terms of
frequency rather than period is more useful.

:::

## Oscillation with Angular Velocity

An understanding of oscillation, amplitude, and period (or frequency)
can be essential in the course of simulating real-world behaviors.
However, there's a slightly easier way to implement the simple harmonic
motion from Example 3.5, one that achieves the same result with fewer
variables. Take one more look at the oscillation formula:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let x = amplitude * sin(TWO_PI * frameCount / period);
```

Now I'll rewrite it in a slightly different way:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let x = amplitude * sin( some value that increments slowly );
```

If you care about precisely defining the period of oscillation in terms
of frames of animation, you might need the formula as I first wrote it.
If you don't care about the exact period, however---for example, if
you'll be choosing it randomly---all you really need inside the `sin()`
function is a value that increments slowly enough for the object's
motion to appear smooth from one frame to the next. Every time this
value ticks past a multiple of [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"}, the object
will have completed one cycle of oscillation.

This technique mirrors what I did with Perlin noise in [Chapter
0](/random#section-random). In that case, I incremented an offset
variable (which I called `t` or `xoff`) to sample various outputs from
the `noise()` function, creating a smooth transition of values. Now, I'm
going to increment a value (I'll call it `angle`) that's fed into the
`sin()` function. The difference is that the output from `sin()` is a
smoothly repeating sine wave, without any randomness.

You might be wondering why I refer to the incrementing value as `angle`,
given that the object has no visible rotation. The term *angle* is used
because the value is passed into the `sin()` function, and angles are
the traditional inputs to trigonometric functions. With this in mind, I
can reintroduce the concept of angular velocity (and acceleration) to
rewrite the example to calculate the `x` position in terms of a changing
angle. I'll assume these global variables:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let angle = 0;
let angleVelocity = 0.05;
```

I can then write this:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
function draw() {
  angle += angleVelocity;
  let x = amplitude * sin(angle);
}
```

Here `angle` is my "value that increments slowly," and the amount it
slowly increments by is `angleVelocity`.

  let amplitude = 200;
  let x = amplitude * sin(angle);
  //{!1} Use the concept of angular velocity to increment an angle variable.

  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  stroke(0);
  fill(127);
  line(0, 0, x, 0);
  circle(x, 0, 48);
}
```

Just because I'm not referencing the period directly doesn't mean that
I've eliminated the concept. After all, the greater the angular
velocity, the faster the circle will oscillate (and therefore the
shorter the period). In fact, the period is the number of frames it
takes for `angle` to increment by [2\\pi]{data-type="equation"}. Since
the amount `angle` increments is controlled by the angular velocity, I
can calculate the period as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{period} = 2\\pi / \\text{angular velocity}
:::

To illustrate the power of thinking of oscillation in terms of angular
velocity, I'll expand the example a bit more by creating an `Oscillator`
class whose objects can oscillate independently along both the x-axis
(as before) *and* the y-axis. The class will need two angles, two
angular velocities, and two amplitudes (one for each axis).

This is a perfect opportunity to use `createVector()` to package each
pair of values together! Unlike previous vectors, the values in these
vectors won't be sets of Cartesian coordinates. Nevertheless, the
`p5.Vector` class provides a convenient way to manage pairs of
values---in this case, pairs of angles (and their associated velocities,
accelerations, and so on).

    // Draw the oscillator as a line connecting a circle.
    line(0, 0, x, y);
    circle(x, y, 32);

  }
}
```

To better understand the `Oscillator` class, it might be helpful to
focus on the movement of a single oscillator in the animation. First,
observe its horizontal movement. You'll notice that it oscillates
regularly back and forth along the x-axis. Switching your focus to its
vertical movement, you'll see it oscillating up and down along the
y-axis. Each oscillator has its own distinct rhythm, given the random
initialization of its angle, angular velocity, and amplitude.

The key is to recognize that the `x` and `y` properties of the
`p5.Vector` objects `this.angle`, `this.angleVelocity`, and
`this.amplitude` aren't tied to spatial vectors anymore. Instead,
they're used to store the respective properties for two separate
oscillations (one along the x-axis, one along the y-axis). Ultimately,
these oscillations are manifested spatially when `x` and `y` are
calculated in the `show()` method, mapping the oscillations onto the
positions of the object.

## Waves

Imagine a single circle oscillating up and down according to the sine
function. This is the equivalent of simulating a single point along the
x-axis of a wave. With a little panache and a `for` loop, you can
animate the entire wave by placing a series of oscillating circles next
to one another (Figure 3.12).

<figcaption>Figure 3.12: Animating the sine wave with oscillating
circles</figcaption>
</figure>

You could use this wavy pattern to design the body or appendages of a
creature, or to simulate a soft surface (such as water). Let's dive into
how the code for this sketch works.

Here, the same concepts of amplitude (the wave's height) and period (the
wave's duration) come into play. However, when drawing the entire wave,
the term *period* shifts its meaning from representing time to
describing the width (in pixels) of a full wave cycle. The term for the
spatial period (as opposed to the temporal period) of a wave is
**wavelength**---the distance a wave travels to complete one full
oscillation cycle. And just as with the previous oscillation example,
you have the choice of computing the wave pattern according to a precise
wavelength or by arbitrarily incrementing the angle value (*delta
angle*) for each spot on the wave.

I'll go with the simpler case, incrementing the angle. I know I need
three variables: an angle, a delta angle (analogous to the previous
angular velocity), and an amplitude:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let angle = 0;
let deltaAngle = 0.2;
let amplitude = 100;
```

Then I'm going to loop through all the `x` values for each point on the
wave. For now, I'll put 24 pixels between adjacent `x` values. For each
`x`, I'll follow these three steps:

1.  Calculate the y-position according to amplitude and the sine of the
    angle.
2.  Draw a circle at the (*x*, *y*) position.
3.  Increment the angle by the delta angle.

The following example translates these steps into code.

Although I'm not precisely calculating the wavelength, you can see that
the greater the change in angle, the shorter the wavelength. It's also
worth noting that as the wavelength decreases, it becomes more difficult
to make out the wave since the vertical distance between the individual
points increases.

Notice that everything in Example 3.8 happens inside `setup()`, so the
result is static. The wave never changes or undulates. Adding motion is
a bit tricky. Your first instinct might be to say, "Hey, no problem,
I'll just put the `for` loop inside the `draw()` function and let
`angle` continue incrementing from one cycle to the next."

That's a nice thought, but it doesn't work. If you try it out, the
result will appear extremely erratic and glitchy. To understand why,
look back at Example 3.8. The right edge of the wave doesn't match the
height of the left edge, so where the wave ends in one cycle of `draw()`
can't be where it starts in the next. Instead, you need a variable
dedicated entirely to tracking the starting `angle` value in each frame
of the animation. This variable (which I'll call `startAngle`)
increments at its own pace, controlling how much the wave progresses
from one frame to the next.

let startAngle = 0;
let deltaAngle = 0.2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 240);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  //{!1} Each time through draw(), the angle that increments is set to startAngle.
  let angle = startAngle;
  for (let x = 0; x <= width; x += 24) {
    let y = map(sin(angle), -1, 1, 0, height);
    stroke(0);

    circle(x, y, 48);
    angle += deltaAngle;
  }
  // Increment the starting angle.
  startAngle += 0.02;
}
```

In this code example, the increment of `startAngle` is hardcoded to be
`0.02`, but you may want to consider reusing `deltaAngle` or creating a
second variable instead. By reusing `deltaAngle`, the spatial
progression of the wave would be tied to the temporal one, possibly
creating a more synchronized movement. Introducing a separate variable,
perhaps called `startAngleVelocity`, would allow independent control of
the speed of the wave. The term *velocity* is appropriate here since the
start angle is changing over time.

## Spring Forces

::: half-width-right
![Figure 3.14: A spring with an anchor and
bob](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_11.png)
:::

Exploring the mathematics of triangles and waves has been lovely, but
perhaps you're starting to miss Newton's laws of motion and vectors.
After all, the core of this book is about simulating the physics of
moving bodies. In ["Properties of
Oscillation"](#properties-of-oscillation){.page-reference}, I modeled
simple harmonic motion by mapping a sine wave to a range of pixels on a
canvas. Exercise 3.7 asked you to use this technique to create a
simulation of a bob hanging from a spring with the `sin()` function.
That kind of quick-and-dirty, one-line-of-code solution won't do,
however, if what you really want is a bob hanging from a spring that
responds to other forces in the environment (wind, gravity, and so on).
To achieve a simulation like that, you need to model the force of the
spring by using vectors.

I'll consider a spring to be a connection between a movable bob (or
weight) and a fixed anchor point (see Figure 3.14).

::: half-width-right

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.15: A springâ€™s extension
(<em>x</em>) is the difference between its current length and its rest
length.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

The force of the spring is a vector calculated according to Hooke's law,
named for Robert Hooke, a British physicist who developed the formula in
1660. Hooke originally stated the law in Latin: "*Ut tensio, sic vis*,"
or "As the extension, so the force." Think of it this way:

[The force of the spring is directly proportional to the extension of
the spring.]{.highlight}

The extension is a measure of how much the spring has been stretched or
compressed: as shown in Figure 3.15, it's the difference between the
current length of the spring and the spring's resting length (its
equilibrium state). Hooke's law therefore says that if you pull on the
bob a lot, the spring's force will be strong, whereas if you pull on the
bob a little, the force will be weak.

Mathematically, the law is stated as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
F\_{spring} = -kx
:::

Here *k* is the *spring constant*. Its value scales the force, setting
how elastic or rigid the spring is. Meanwhile, *x* is the extension, the
current length minus the rest length.

Now remember, force is a vector, so you need to calculate both magnitude
and direction. For the code, I'll start with the following three
variables---two vectors for the anchor and bob positions, and one rest
length:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// Pick arbitrary values for the positions and rest length.
let anchor = createVector(0, 0);
let bob = createVector(0, 120);
let restLength = 100;
```

I'll then use Hooke's law to calculate the magnitude of the force. For
that, I need `k` and `x`. Calculating `k` is easy; it's just a constant,
so I'll make something up:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let k = 0.1;
```

Finding `x` is perhaps a bit more difficult. I need to know the
difference between the current length and the rest length. The rest
length is defined as the variable `restLength`. What's the current
length? The distance between the anchor and the bob. And how can I
calculate that distance? How about the magnitude of a vector that points
from the anchor to the bob? (Note that this is exactly the same process
I employed to find the distance between objects for the purposes of
calculating gravitational attraction in [Chapter
2](/forces#section-forces).)

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
//{!1} A vector pointing from the anchor to the bob gives you the current length of the spring.
let dir = p5.Vector.sub(bob, anchor);
let currentLength = dir.mag();
let x = currentLength - restLength;
```

Now that I've sorted out the elements necessary for the magnitude of the
force (--*kx*), I need to figure out the direction, a unit vector
pointing in the direction of the force. The good news is that I already
have this vector. Right? Just a moment ago I asked the question, "How
can I calculate that distance?" and I answered, "How about the magnitude
of a vector that points from the anchor to the bob?" Well, that vector
describes the direction of the force!

Figure 3.16 shows that if you stretch the spring beyond its rest length,
a force should pull it back toward the anchor. And if the spring shrinks
below its rest length, the force should push it away from the anchor.
The Hooke's law formula accounts for this reversal of direction with the
--1.

![Figure 3.16: The spring force points in the opposite direction of the
displacement.](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_13.png)

All I need to do now is set the magnitude of the vector used for the
distance calculation. Let's take a look at the code and rename that
vector variable `force`:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
// The magnitude of the spring force according to Hookeâ€™s law
let k = 0.1;
let force = p5.Vector.sub(bob, anchor);
let currentLength = force.mag();
let x = currentLength - restLength;
// Put it together: direction and magnitude!
force.setMag(-1 * k * x);
```

Now that I have the algorithm for computing the spring force, the
question remains: What OOP structure should I use? This is one of those
situations that has no one correct answer. Several possibilities exist,
and the one I choose depends on my goals and personal coding style.

Since I've been working all along with a `Mover` class, I'll stick with
this same framework. I'll think of the `Mover` class as the spring's
bob. The bob needs `position`, `velocity`, and `acceleration` vectors to
move about the canvas. Perfect---I have those already! And perhaps the
bob experiences a gravity force via the `applyForce()` method. This
leaves just one more step, applying the spring force:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let bob;

function setup() {
  bob = new Bob();
}

function draw()  {
  //{!2} Chapter 2â€™s make-up-a-gravity force
  let gravity = createVector(0, 1);
  bob.applyForce(gravity);
  // Calculate and apply a spring force!
  let springForce = _______________????
  bob.applyForce(springForce);
  // The standard update() and show() methods
  bob.update();
  bob.show();
}
```

One option would be to write all the spring-force code in the main
`draw()` loop. But thinking ahead to when you might have multiple bob
and spring connections, it would be wise to create an additional class,
a `Spring` class. As shown in Figure 3.17, the `Bob` class keeps track
of the bob's movements; the `Spring` class keeps track of the spring's
anchor position and its rest length, and calculates the spring force on
the bob.

<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_14.png"
alt="Figure 3.17: The Spring class has anchor and rest length; the Bob class has position, velocity, and acceleration." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.17: The <code>Spring</code>
class has anchor and rest length; the <code>Bob</code> class has
position, velocity, and acceleration.</figcaption>
</figure>

This allows me to write a lovely sketch as follows:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
let bob;
// Add a Spring object.
let spring;

function setup() {
  bob = new Bob();
  spring = new Spring();
}

function draw()  {
  let gravity = createVector(0, 1);
  bob.applyForce(gravity);
  //{!1} This new method in the Spring class will take care of computing the force of the spring on the bob.
  spring.connect(bob);
  bob.update();
  bob.show();
  spring.show();
}
```

Think about how this compares to my first stab at gravitational
attraction in Example 2.6, when I had separate `Mover` and `Attractor`
classes. There, I wrote something like this:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  let force = attractor.attract(mover);
  mover.applyForce(force);
```

The analogous situation with a spring might have been as follows:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  let force = spring.connect(bob);
  bob.applyForce(force);
```

Instead, in this example I have the following:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  spring.connect(bob);
```

What gives? Why don't I need to call `applyForce()` on the bob? The
answer, of course, is that I *do* need to call `applyForce()` on the
bob. It's just that instead of doing it in `draw()`, I'm demonstrating
that a perfectly reasonable (and sometimes preferable) alternative is to
ask the `connect()` method to call `applyForce()` on the bob internally:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  connect(bob) {
    let force = some fancy calculations
    // The connect() method takes care of calling applyForce() and therefore doesnâ€™t have to return a vector to the calling area.
    bob.applyForce(force);
  }
```

Why do it one way with the `Attractor` class and another way with the
`Spring` class? When I first discussed forces, showing all the forces
being applied in the `draw()` loop was a clearer way to help you learn
about force accumulation. Now that you're more comfortable, perhaps it's
simpler to embed some of the details inside the objects themselves.

Let's take a look at the rest of the elements in the `Spring` class.

and incorporates two additional features: (1) the `Bob` class includes
methods for mouse interactivity, allowing you to drag the bob around the
window, and (2) the `Spring` class includes a method to constrain the
connection's length between a minimum and a maximum value.

## The Pendulum

::: half-width-right
![Figure 3.18: A pendulum with a pivot, arm, and
bob](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_15.png)
:::

You might have noticed that in Example 3.10's spring code, I never once
used sine or cosine. Before you write off all this trigonometry stuff as
a tangent, however, allow me to show an example of how it all fits
together. Imagine a bob hanging from an anchor connected by a spring
with a fully rigid connection that can be neither compressed nor
extended. This idealized scenario describes a pendulum and provides an
excellent opportunity to practice combining all that you've learned
about forces and trigonometry.

A **pendulum** is a bob suspended by an arm from a pivot (previously
called the *anchor* in the spring). When the pendulum is at rest, it
hangs straight down, as in Figure 3.18. If you lift up the pendulum at
an angle from its resting state and then release it, however, it starts
to swing back and forth, tracing the shape of an arc. A real-world
pendulum would live in a 3D space, but I'm going to look at a simpler
scenario: a pendulum in the 2D space of a p5.js canvas. Figure 3.19
shows the pendulum in a nonresting position and adds the forces at play:
gravity and tension.

When the pendulum swings, its arm and bob are essentially rotating
around the fixed point of the pivot. If no arm connected the bob and the
pivot, the bob would simply fall to the ground under the influence of
gravity. Obviously, that isn't what happens. Instead, the fixed length
of the arm creates the second force---tension. However, I'm not going to
work with this scenario according to these forces, at least not in the
way I approached the spring scenario.

::: half-width-right

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.19: A pendulum showing <span
data-type="equation">\theta</span> as the angle relative to its resting
position</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

Instead of using *linear* acceleration and velocity, I'm going to
describe the motion of the pendulum in terms of *angular* acceleration
and *angular* velocity, which refer to the change of the arm's angle
[\\theta]{data-type="equation"} relative to the pendulum's resting
position. I should first warn you, especially if you're a seasoned
physicist, that I'm going to conveniently ignore several important
concepts here: conservation of energy, momentum, centripetal force, and
more. This isn't intended to be a comprehensive description of pendulum
physics. My goal is to offer you an opportunity to practice your new
skills in trigonometry and further explore the relationship between
forces and angles through a concrete example.

To calculate the pendulum's angular acceleration, I'm going to use
Newton's second law of motion but with a little trigonometric twist.
Take a look at Figure 3.19 and tilt your head\
so that the pendulum's arm becomes the vertical axis. The force of
gravity suddenly points askew, a little to the left---it's at an angle
with respect to your tilted head. If this is starting to hurt your neck,
don't worry. I'll redraw the tilted figure and relabel the forces
[F_g]{data-type="equation"} for gravity and [T]{data-type="equation"}
for tension (Figure 3.20, left).

Let's now take the force of gravity and divide its vector into x- and
y-components, with the arm as the new y-axis*.* These components form a
right triangle, with the force of gravity as the hypotenuse (Figure
3.20, right). I'll call them [F\_{gx}]{data-type="equation"} and
[F\_{gy}]{data-type="equation"}, but what do these components mean?
Well, the [F\_{gy}]{data-type="equation"} component represents the force
that's opposite to [T]{data-type="equation"}, the tension force.
Remember, the tension force is what keeps the bob from falling off.

The other component, [F\_{gx}]{data-type="equation"}, is perpendicular
to the arm of the pendulum, and it's the force I've been looking for all
along! It causes the pendulum to rotate. As the pendulum swings, the
y-axis (the arm) will always be perpendicular to the direction of
motion. Therefore, I can ignore the tension and
[F\_{gy}]{data-type="equation"} forces and focus on
[F\_{gx}]{data-type="equation"}, which is the **net force** in the
direction of motion. And because this force is part of a right triangle,
I can calculate it with . . . you guessed it, trigonometry!

<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_17.png"
alt="Figure 3.20: On the left, the pendulum is drawn rotated so that the arm is the y-axis. The right shows F_g zoomed in and divided into components F_{gx} and F_{gy}." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.20: On the left, the pendulum is
drawn rotated so that the arm is the y-axis. The right shows <span
data-type="equation">F_g</span> zoomed in and divided into components
<span data-type="equation">F_{gx}</span> and <span
data-type="equation">F_{gy}</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>

The key here is that the top angle of the right triangle is the same as
the angle [\\theta]{data-type="equation"} between the pendulum's arm and
its resting position. Just as I demonstrated in the discussion of polar
coordinates, the sine and cosine functions allow me to separate out the
components of the gravity force (the hypotenuse) according to this
angle. For [F\_{gx}]{data-type="equation"}, I need to use sine:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\sin(\\theta) = F\_{gx} / F_g
:::

Solving for [F\_{gx}]{data-type="equation"}, I get this:

::: {data-type="equation"}
F\_{gx} = F_g \\times \\sin(\\theta)
:::

I'll now rename this force [F_p]{data-type="equation"} for *force of the
pendulum*. In Figure 3.21, I've restored the diagram to its original
orientation and relabeled the components. I've also moved the starting
point of [F_p]{data-type="equation"} from the bottom of the right
triangle to the bob's center, to clarify how this force moves the bob.

There it is. The net force of the pendulum that causes the rotation is
calculated as follows:

::: {data-type="equation"}
F_p = F_g \\times \\sin(\\theta)
:::

<figure>
<img src="images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_18.png"
alt="Figure 3.21: F_{gx} is now labeled F_p, the net force in the direction of motion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3.21: <span
data-type="equation">F_{gx}</span> is now labeled <span
data-type="equation">F_p</span>, the net force in the direction of
motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

Lest you forget, however, my goal is to determine the angular
acceleration of the pendulum. Once I have that, I'll be able to apply
the rules of motion to find a new angle [\\theta]{data-type="equation"}
for each frame of the animation:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{angular velocity} = \\text{angular velocity} + \\text{angular
acceleration}
:::

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{angle} = \\text{angle + angular velocity}
:::

The good news is that Newton's second law establishes a relationship
between force and acceleration---namely, [F = M \\times
A]{data-type="equation"}, or [A = F / M]{data-type="equation"}. So if
the force of the pendulum is equal to the force of gravity times the
sine of the angle, then I have this:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\text{pendulum angular acceleration} = \\text{acceleration due to
gravity} \\times \\sin(\\theta)
:::

This is a good time for a reminder that the context here is creative
coding and not pure physics. Yes, the acceleration due to gravity on
Earth is 9.8 meters per second squared. But this number isn't relevant
in our world of pixels. Instead, I'll use an arbitrary constant (called
`gravity`) as a variable that scales the acceleration (incidentally,
angular acceleration is usually written as
[\\alpha]{data-type="equation"} so as to distinguish it from linear
acceleration [A]{data-type="equation"}):

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\alpha = \\text{gravity} \\times \\sin(\\theta)
:::

Before I put everything together, there's another detail I neglected to
mention. Or really, lots of little details. Think about the pendulum arm
for a moment. Is it a metal rod? A string? A rubber band? How is it
attached to the pivot point? How long is it? What's its mass? Is it a
windy day? I could continue to ask a lot of questions that would affect
the simulation. I choose to live, however, in a fantasy world, one where
the pendulum's arm is an idealized rod that never bends and where the
mass of the bob is concentrated in a single, infinitesimally small
point.

Even though I prefer not to worry myself with all these questions, a
critical piece is still missing, related to the calculation of angular
acceleration. To keep the derivation of the pendulum's angular
acceleration simple, I assumed that the length of the pendulum's arm
is 1. In reality, however, the length of the pendulum's arm affects the
acceleration of the pendulum because of the concepts of torque and
moment of inertia.

**Torque** (or [\\tau]{data-type="equation"}) is a measure of the
rotational force acting on an object. In the case of a pendulum, torque
is proportional to both the mass of the bob and the length of the arm
([M \\times r]{data-type="equation"}). The **moment of inertia** (or
[I]{data-type="equation"}) of a pendulum is a measure of the amount of
difficulty in rotating the pendulum around the pivot point. It's
proportional to the mass of the bob andÂ the *square* of the length of
the arm ([Mr\^2]{data-type="equation"}).

Remember Newton's second law, [F=M \\times A]{data-type="equation"}?
Well, it has a rotational counterpart, [\\tau = I \\times
\\alpha]{data-type="equation"}. By rearranging the equation to solve for
the angular acceleration [\\alpha]{data-type="equation"}, I get [\\alpha
= \\tau/I]{data-type="equation"}. Simplifying further, this becomes
[Mr/Mr\^2]{data-type="equation"} or [1/r]{data-type="equation"}. The
angular acceleration doesn't depend on the pendulum's mass!

This is just like Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment
demonstrating linear acceleration, where different objects fell at the
same rate, regardless of their mass. Here, once again, the mass of a bob
doesn't influence its angular acceleration---only the length of its arm
does. Thus, the final formula becomes this:

::: {data-type="equation"}
\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{gravity} \\times \\sin(\\theta)}{r}
:::

Amazing! In the end, the formula is so simple that you might be
wondering why I bothered going through the explanation at all. I mean,
learning is great, but I could have easily just said, "Hey, the angular
acceleration of a pendulum is a constant times the sine of the angle
divided by the length of the arm." That would be missing the point. The
purpose of this book isn't to learn how pendulums swing or gravity
works. The point is to think creatively about how shapes can move around
a screen in a computationally based graphics system. The pendulum is
just a case study. If you can understand the approach to programming a
pendulum, you can apply the same techniques to other scenarios, no
matter how you choose to design your p5.js canvas world.

Now, I'm not finished yet. I may be happy with my simple, elegant
formula for angular acceleration, but I still have to apply it in code.
This is an excellent opportunity to practice some OOP skills and create
a `Pendulum` class. First, think about all the properties of a pendulum
that I've mentioned:

::: avoid-break
-   Arm length
-   Angle
-   Angular velocity
-   Angular acceleration
:::

The `Pendulum` class needs all these properties too:

::: snip-below
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
class Pendulum  {
  constructor() {
    // Length of arm
    this.r = ????;
    // Pendulum arm angle
    this.angle = ????;
    // Angular velocity
    this.angleVelocity = ????;
    // Angular acceleration
    this.angleAcceleration = ????;
  } 
```
:::

Next, I need to write an `update()` method to update the pendulum's
angle according to the formula:

::: {.snip-above .snip-below}
``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
  update() {
    // An arbitrary constant
    let gravity = 0.4;
    // Calculate acceleration according to the formula.
    this.angleAcceleration = -1 * gravity * sin(this.angle) / this.r;
    // Increment the velocity.
    this.angleVelocity += this.angleAcceleration;
    // Increment the angle.
    this.angle += this.angleVelocity;
  }
```
:::

Note that the acceleration calculation now includes a multiplication by
--1. When the pendulum is to the right of its resting position, the
angle is positive, and so the sine of the angle is also positive.
However, gravity should pull the bob back toward the resting position.
Conversely, when the pendulum is to the left of its resting position,
the angle is negative, and so its sine is negative too. In this case,
the pulling force should be positive. Multiplying by --1 is necessary in
both scenarios.

Next, I need a `show()` method to draw the pendulum on the canvas. But
where exactly should I draw it? How do I calculate the x- and
y-coordinates (Cartesian!) for both the pendulum's pivot point (let's
call it `pivot`) and bob position (let's call it `bob`)? This may be
getting a little tiresome, but the answer, yet again, is trigonometry,
as shown in Figure 3.22.

![Figure 3.22: The bob position relative to the pivot in polar and
Cartesian coordinates](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_19.png)

First, I'll need to add a `this.pivot` property to the constructor to
specify where to draw the pendulum on the canvas:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
this.pivot = createVector(100, 10);
```

I know the bob should be a set distance away from the pivot, as
determined by the arm length. That's my variable `r`, which I'll set
now:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
this.r = 125;
```

I also know the bob's current angle relative to the pivot: it's stored
in the variable `angle`. Between the arm length and the angle, what I
have is a polar coordinate for the bob:
[(r,\\theta)]{data-type="equation"}. What I really need is a Cartesian
coordinate, but luckily I already know how to use sine and cosine to
convert from polar to Cartesian. And so:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
this.bob = createVector(r * sin(this.angle), r * cos(this.angle));
```

Notice that I'm using `sin(this.angle)` for the *x* value and
`cos(this.angle)` for the *y*. This is the opposite of what I showed you
in ["Polar vs. Cartesian
Coordinates"](#polar-vs-cartesian-coordinates){.page-reference}. The
reason is that I'm now looking for the top angle of a right triangle
pointing down, as depicted in Figure 3.21. This angle lives between the
y-axis and the hypotenuse, instead of between the x-axis and the
hypotenuse, as you saw earlier in Figure 3.9.

Right now, the value of `this.bob` is assuming that the pivot is at
point (0, 0). To get the bob's position relative to wherever the pivot
*actually* happens to be, I can just add `pivot` to the `bob` vector:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
this.bob.add(this.pivot);
```

Now all that remains is the little matter of drawing a line and a circle
(you should be more creative, of course):

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
stroke(0);
fill(127);
line(this.pivot.x, this.pivot.y, this.bob.x, this.bob.y);
circle(this.bob.x, this.bob.y, 16);
```

Finally, a real-world pendulum is going to experience a certain amount
of friction (at the pivot point) and air resistance. As it stands, the
pendulum would swing forever with the given code. To make it more
realistic, I can slow the pendulum with a damping trick. I say *trick*
because rather than model the resistance forces with some degree of
accuracy (as I did in [Chapter 2](/forces#section-forces)), I can
achieve a similar result simply by reducing the angular velocity by an
arbitrary amount during each cycle. The following code reduces the
velocity by 1 percent (or multiplies it by 0.99) for each frame of
animation:

``` {.codesplit code-language="javascript"}
this.angleVelocity *= 0.99;
```

Putting everything together, I have the following example (with the
pendulum beginning at a 45-degree angle).

  show() {

    this.bob.set(this.r * sin(this.angle), this.r * cos(this.angle));
    this.bob.add(this.pivot);
    // The arm

    line(this.pivot.x, this.pivot.y, this.bob.x, this.bob.y);
    // The bob

On the book's website, this example has additional code to allow the
user to grab the pendulum and swing it with the mouse.

### Exercise 3.15 {#exercise-315}

String together a series of pendulums so that the bob of one is the
pivot point of another. Note that doing this may produce intriguing
results but will be wildly inaccurate physically. Simulating an actual
double pendulum requires sophisticated equations. You can read about
them in the [Wolfram Research article on double
pendulums](https://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html)
or [watch my video on coding a double
pendulum](https://thecodingtrain.com/doublependulum).

### Exercise 3.16 {#exercise-316}

![image](images/03_oscillation/03_oscillation_20.png)

Using trigonometry, how do you calculate the magnitude of the **normal
force** depicted here (the force perpendicular to the incline on which
the sled rests)? You can consider the magnitude of
[F\_\\text{gravity}]{data-type="equation"} to be a known constant. Look
for a right triangle to help get you started. After all, the normal
force is equal and opposite to a component of the force of gravity. If
it helps to draw over the diagram and make more right triangles, go for
it!

::: {data-type="exercise"}
### Exercise 3.17 {#exercise-317}

Create a simulation of a box sliding down an incline with friction. Note
that the magnitude of the friction force is proportional to the normal
force, as discussed in the previous exercise.

### The Ecosystem Project {#the-ecosystem-project-4}

Take one of your creatures and incorporate oscillation into its motion.
You can use the `Oscillator` class from Example 3.7 as a model. The
`Oscillator` object, however, oscillates around a single point (the
middle of the window). Try oscillating around a moving point.

In other words, design a creature that moves around the screen according
to position, velocity, and acceleration. But that creature isn't just a
static shape; it's an oscillating body. Consider tying the speed of
oscillation to the speed of motion. Think of a butterfly's flapping
wings or the legs of an insect. Can you make it appear as though the
creature's internal mechanics (oscillation) drive its locomotion? See
the book's website for an additional example combining attraction from
[Chapter 2](/forces#section-forces) with oscillation.
